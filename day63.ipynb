Each neuron in one layer connects to neurons in the next layer.\n","\n","- **Weights and Biases:** Parameters that the network learns during training. Weights adjust the importance of inputs, and biases allow the activation threshold to be shifted, facilitating the learning process.\n","- **Activation Function:** A function that helps the network learn complex patterns.

Without activation functions, the neural network would simply perform linear transformations, making it unable to handle more complex tasks. Here are some commonly used activation functions and their characteristics:\n","\n","**1. Sigmoid Activation Function:**\n","- **Formula:** $ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $\n","- **Range:** (0, 1)\n","- **Properties:**\n","  - Squashes input values to a range between 0 and 1.\n","  - Often used in the output layer of binary classification problems.\n","  - Can cause the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation due to its derivative being very small for large positive or negative inputs.\n","\n","**2. Tanh Activation Function:**\n","- **Formula:** $ \\text{tanh}(x) = \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} $\n","- **Range:** (-1, 1)\n","- **Properties:**\n","  - Squashes input values to a range between -1 and 1.\n","  - Zero-centered, which helps in centering the data and making optimization easier.\n","  - Also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, but to a lesser extent than the sigmoid function.\n","\n","**3. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function:**\n","- **Formula:** $ \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x) $\n","- **Range:** [0, âˆž)\n","- **Properties:**\n","  - Introduces non-linearity while allowing for faster training and avoiding the vanishing gradient problem.\n","  - Computationally efficient as it involves simple thresholding at zero.\n","  - Can suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where neurons get stuck at zero and stop learning. Variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU address this issue.\n","\n","**4. Leaky ReLU Activation Function:**\n","- **Formula:** $ \\text{Leaky ReLU}(x) = \\max(0.01x, x) $\n","- **Range:** (-âˆž, âˆž)\n","- **Properties:**\n","  - Allows a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative.\n","  - Helps mitigate the dying ReLU problem by ensuring that neurons continue to learn even when they receive negative inputs.\n","\n","**5. Softmax Activation Function:**\n","- **Formula:** $ \\text{Softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_{j} e^{x_j}} $\n","- **Range:** (0, 1) (for each output neuron, the sum of outputs is 1)\n","- **Properties:**\n","  - Converts logits (raw prediction values) into probabilities, making it useful for multi-class classification problems.\n","  - Ensures that the output probabilities sum up to 1, allowing for interpretation as a probability distribution.\n","\n","**6. Swish Activation Function:**\n","- **Formula:** $ \\text{Swish}(x) = x \\cdot \\sigma(x) $\n","- **Range:** (-âˆž, âˆž)\n","- **Properties:**\n","  - Smooth, non-monotonic function that tends to perform better than ReLU on deeper networks.\n","  - Self-gated, meaning the function can adjust its own behavior based on the input.\n","\n","### Choosing Activation Functions\n","\n","The choice of activation function depends on the specific problem and the architecture of the neural network.
